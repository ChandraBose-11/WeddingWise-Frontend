      A wedding planner is a professional who assists with the design, planning
      and management of a client's wedding. Weddings are significant events in
      people's lives and as such, couples are often willing to spend
      considerable amount of money to ensure that their weddings are
      well-organized. Wedding planners are often used by couples who work long
      hours and have little spare time available for sourcing and managing
      wedding venues and wedding suppliers. Professional wedding planners are
      based worldwide but the industry is the largest in the USA, India, western
      Europe and China.[1][2] Various wedding planning courses are available to
      those who wish to pursue the career.[3] Planners generally charge either a
      percentage of the total wedding cost, or a flat fee.[4][5] Planners are
      also popular with couples planning a destination wedding, where the
      documentation and paperwork can be complicated. Any country where a
      wedding is held requires different procedures depending on the nationality
      of each the bride and the groom. For instance, US citizens marrying in
      Italy require a Nulla Osta (affidavit sworn in front of the US consulate
      in Italy), plus an Atto Notorio (sworn in front of the Italian consulate
      in the US or at a court in Italy), and legalization of the above. Some
      countries instead have agreements and the couple can get their No
      Impediment forms from their local registrar and have it translated by the
      consulate in the country of the wedding. A local wedding planner can take
      care of the different procedures. Services The services of a wedding
      planner may include: Interview the couple and parents to identify their
      needs. Preparation of the budget Design and style of the event Scouting
      locations Photoshoots Planning a detailed checklist (about a year in
